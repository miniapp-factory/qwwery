+Technical Specification (TS) – Coin Flip Randomizer with Multiple Modes
+1. Project Overview
+
+The Coin Flip Randomizer is a simple application designed to simulate coin tosses with different modes and variations. The program provides a clean interface, multiple randomization options, statistics tracking, and customizable coin designs.
+The tool is meant for games, decision-making, testing randomness, or entertainment.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Basic Coin Flip
+
+The program must provide:
+
+A standard Heads or Tails random result
+
+Visual animation of a coin flip (optional)
+
+Instant output if animation is disabled
+
+Output format examples:
+
+“Heads” / “Tails”
+
+Icon-based display
+
+Custom text if user enables custom labels
+
+2.2 Multiple Flip Modes
+
+The program must include several flip variations:
+
+Mode 1: Single Flip
+
+One flip per click
+
+Displays result immediately
+
+Mode 2: Multi-Flip
+
+User selects number of flips (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 1000)
+
+Program shows:
+
+count of Heads
+
+count of Tails
+
+percentage distribution
+
+optional chart (bar or pie chart)
+
+Mode 3: Streak Mode
+
+Tracks longest streaks during flips
+
+Shows:
+
+Longest Heads streak
+
+Longest Tails streak
+
+Current streak
+
+Mode 4: Custom Coin
+
+User can rename “Heads” and “Tails” (e.g., “Yes/No”, “Red/Blue”)
+
+Program behaves like a normal flip but with custom labels
+
+Mode 5: Weighted Coin
+
+User can set probability of Heads or Tails (e.g., 60/40, 75/25)
+
+Program must calculate result based on the chosen weight
+
+2.3 Randomness Engine
+
+Must use a high-quality pseudorandom number generator
+
+Should avoid repeating patterns in short sequences
+
+Optional: “True random mode” using online random API (if available)
+
+2.4 Statistics & History
+
+Keep flip history for the current session
+
+Show:
+
+total flips
+
+Heads/Tails ratio
+
+recent results (e.g., last 20 flips)
+
+Optional: export history to a text or CSV file
+
+3. User Interface Requirements
+
+Simple, clean UI
+
+Large button for coin flip
+
+Clear display of results
+
+Mode selector dropdown/menu
+
+Statistics panel for multi-flip mode
+
+Light/Dark mode
+
+Optional:
+
+coin animation
+
+customizable coin color or image
+
+4. Non-Functional Requirements
+4.1 Platform
+
+The program can be:
+
+Desktop app (Windows/Linux/Mac)
+
+Web app
+
+Mobile app (optional)
+
+4.2 Performance
+
+Single flip results must be instantaneous
+
+Multi-flip (1000+ flips) must complete under 1 second
+
+UI should remain responsive during calculations
+
+4.3 Data Handling
+
+No personal data required
+
+History stored only in current session (unless user saves)
+
+4.4 Safety
+
+Must show a disclaimer:
+“This randomizer is for entertainment and simulation purposes only.”
+
+5. Technical Stack (Recommended)
+Option A – Desktop (Python)
+
+Python
+
+Tkinter or PyQt
+
+Random module for RNG
+
+Matplotlib for charts
+
+Option B – Web App
+
+HTML/CSS/JavaScript
+
+Canvas or SVG for coin animation
+
+Chart.js for statistics
+
+LocalStorage for session history
+
+Option C – Mobile
+
+Flutter or React Native
+
+6. Future Expansion
+
+Dice roll modes
+
+Spinner mode (like a wheel)
+
+“Tournament flip” mode
+
+Multiple coins flipped simultaneously
+
+Custom coin images upload
+
+Sound effects
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
